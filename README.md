> # Dog-Breed-Detection-Using-Inception-Neural-Network
### I have Trained a Xception Neural Network For Predicting the Breed of a Dog From a Image Using Transfer Learning.
### --> This is Pretrained Model(Like ImageNet) But We Can Negate the Weights Of the Final Output Layer and Modify For Our Needs.
### --> This Helps Our Neural Network To Train in Lower Data(Also Not Much Computation Power)
### This Model is Trained On 70 Breeds Of Dog.

> How To Use This Model?
- [x] Load The Model(.h5) Weights File Into Memory(After Training Network)
- [x] Copy-Past the Pre-Processing Function From My Notebook
- [x] Get The Dog Image And Feed Into the Pre-Processing Function And Wait For the Results ðŸ˜‰
